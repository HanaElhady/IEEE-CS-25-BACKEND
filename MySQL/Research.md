# What is a Database and Why Does it Exist?

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

# What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a specialized programming language designed for managing and manipulating data stored in relational databases. It allows users to perform various operations on the data, such as querying, updating, inserting, and deleting records. SQL is widely used in database systems like MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.

# What is the History of MySQL?

MySQL, a Swedish company, was credited for being the founder of the MySQL database server. Three engineers‚ÄîDavid Axmark, Allan Larsson, and Michael Widenius‚Äîstarted their work on the MySQL server development in 1995. They released their first MySQL server on the same date.

Later, a US tech firm named **Sun Microsystems** took complete ownership after purchasing **MySQL AB**. In 2010, **Oracle**, a US tech giant, acquired Sun Microsystems, making MySQL an Oracle-owned product today.

# What Are the Top 5 Most Famous Databases in the World (2025)?

As of 2025, the top five most popular database management systems (DBMS) are:

1. **Oracle Database**
2. **MySQL**
3. **Microsoft SQL Server**
4. **PostgreSQL**
5. **MongoDB**

These databases have gained prominence due to their **performance, scalability, and specific advantages** for different types of applications. Their widespread adoption across various industries underscores their effectiveness in meeting diverse data management needs.

#  What is RDBMS?

**RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)** is a type of database management system that stores and retrieves data in a **tabular format** with rows and columns.  

It was introduced by **E.F. Codd** in the 1970s and is the foundation of popular databases like:  
 **MySQL**  
 **PostgreSQL**  
 **SQL Server**  
 **Oracle**

##  RDBMS vs DBMS

| Feature | **DBMS** | **RDBMS** |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Storage** | Stores data as files | Stores data in tables |
| **Data Structure** | Hierarchical or navigational | Tabular with primary keys |
| **Normalization** | Not supported | Supported |
| **Security** | No strict integrity constraints | Ensures **ACID** properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) |
| **Relationships** | No relationships between tables | Tables are related using **primary/foreign keys** |
| **Scalability** | Suitable for small-scale applications | Supports large-scale applications with **multiple users** |
| **Distributed Database** |  Not supported |  Supported |
| **Examples** | File systems, XML | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle |

**Conclusion**: RDBMS is an **advanced form of DBMS**, offering better **data integrity, security, and scalability**.

##  Naming Conventions

When working with databases, **consistent naming conventions** improve **readability and maintainability**.  

###  Best Practices:
- **Use lowercase and underscores** ‚Üí `customer_orders`  vs `CustomerOrders` 
- **Singular table names** ‚Üí `user`  vs `users`  
- **Consistent primary key naming** ‚Üí `id` or `tablename_id`  
- **Avoid special characters and spaces** (use `_` instead)  
- **Use descriptive column names** ‚Üí `created_at`  vs `date`

#  Difference between Primary Key and Unique key

| Comparison Basis | **Primary Key** | **Unique Key** |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Basic** | The primary key is used as a unique identifier for each record in the table | The unique key is also a unique identifier for records when the primary key is not present in the table |
| **NULL** | We cannot store NULL values in the primary key column | We can store NULL value in the unique key column, but only one NULL is allowed |
| **Purpose** | It enforces entity integrity | It enforces unique data |
| **Index** | The primary key, by default, creates clustered index | The unique key, by default, creates a non-clustered index |
| **Number of Key** | Each table supports only one primary key | A table can have more than one unique key |
| **Value Modification** | We cannot change or delete the primary key values | We can modify the unique key column values | 
| **Uses** | It is used to identify each record in the table | It prevents storing duplicate entries in a column except for a NULL value |
| **Syntax** |  CREATE TABLE Employee
(
Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(150),
address VARCHAR(250)
)
 |  CREATE TABLE Person
(
Id INT UNIQUE,
name VARCHAR(150),
address VARCHAR(250)
) |

# Constraints in MySQL
SQL constraints are rules applied to database tables to ensure data integrity, accuracy, and consistency. These constraints prevent invalid data entry and help maintain database reliability.

### Types of SQL Constraints:
1. **NOT NULL Constraint**
Ensures that a column cannot contain NULL values.

2. **UNIQUE Constraint**
Ensures that values in a column are distinct.

3. **PRIMARY KEY Constraint**
A combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE that uniquely identifies each row.

4. **FOREIGN KEY Constraint**
Establishes a relationship between two tables, ensuring referential integrity.

5. **CHECK Constraint**
Ensures that a column meets specific conditions before inserting data.

6. **DEFAULT Constraint**
Assigns a default value to a column when no value is provided.

# Indexing in MySQL
## How MySQL Uses Indexes
Indexes in MySQL improve query performance by allowing faster data retrieval. Without an index, MySQL scans the entire table, which is inefficient for large datasets. With an index, MySQL can locate data quickly, reducing search time.

## Key Uses of Indexes:

**Speeding Up Searches**  Indexes help quickly find rows matching a WHERE clause.
**Filtering Efficiently** MySQL selects the most selective index to reduce the number of rows scanned.
**Using Multi-Column Indexes** Any leftmost prefix of a multi-column index can be used for lookups.
**Optimizing Joins** Indexes speed up joins when columns in related tables have the same data type and size.
**Handling MIN() & MAX()** MySQL optimizes queries for indexed columns using single key lookups.
**Sorting & Grouping Faster** Indexes improve ORDER BY and GROUP BY performance when applied to indexed columns.
**Covering Indexes** If all required columns are in an index, MySQL retrieves data without accessing the table.

## When Not to Use Indexes:
For small tables where scanning is fast.
When most rows are needed, as sequential reads may be more efficient than index lookups.
