# PHP Overview  

## What is PHP?  
- **PHP** stands for **"PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"**  
- It is a **widely-used, open-source** scripting language  
- PHP scripts are executed **on the server**  
- **Free to use and download**  

---

## What Can PHP Do?  
- Generate **dynamic page content**  
- Handle **file operations** (create, open, read, write, delete, close)  
- Collect **form data**  
- Send and receive **cookies**  
- Manage **databases** (add, delete, modify data)  
- Control **user access**  
- Encrypt data  
- Output **HTML, images, PDFs, XHTML, XML**

# PHP Error Types  

Errors in PHP are classified into three main categories:  

### **1. Syntax Errors**  
### **2. Runtime errors**
### **3. Logical errors**

# PHP `echo` vs `print`

| Feature       | `echo`             | `print`          |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| Arguments    | Accepts multiple | Only one      |
| Return Value | No               | Returns `1`   |
| Speed        | Faster           | Slower        |
| Usage        | Outputs multiple strings | Outputs one string |

**Conclusion:**  
Both `echo` and `print` are useful for displaying output. However, `echo` is **faster** and supports multiple arguments.

# PHP and Case Sensitivity: Why Is It Partially Case Sensitive?  

Unlike most programming languages, PHP has **partial case sensitivity**:

## Case Sensitivity in PHP  

### **Case-Sensitive Elements**  
- Variables  
- Constants (both user-defined and PHP-defined)  
- Array keys  
- Class properties  

### **Case-Insensitive Elements**  
- Functions  
- Class constructors and methods  
- Keywords and constructs (`if`, `else`, `foreach`, `null`, `echo`, etc.)  

## Why Is PHP Partially Case-Sensitive?  

PHPâ€™s hybrid approach was designed to:  
- **Ensure backward compatibility** with older scripts and legacy applications.  
- **Improve readability**, allowing function and class names to be flexible with case variations.  
- **Offer flexibility**, giving developers control over case sensitivity where needed.  

This approach balances **legacy support** with **modern development practices**, making PHP more adaptable.

# Programming language vs scripting language
Programming languages were created to make complex software, whereas scripting languages were created to assist programming languages. Programming languages are compiled whereas scripting 
languages are interpreted. We shall have a look at some differences between programming languages and scripting languages in the next section.


| Programming Language	| Scripting Language |
|------------------|----------------|
|Is a type of computer language that consists of a set of instructions for communicating with computers.	| Is a kind of programming language that is used to automate the execution of operations in a runtime environment. |
|Most programming languages are compiled. The translation overhead is incurred just once when the source is compiled; after that, it merely needs to be loaded and run.|	Most scripting languages are interpreted languages. They must be parsed, interpreted, and executed each time the program is run.|
|Traditional programming languages are based on low-level languages.|	Scripting languages generally prefer high-level languages.|
|Execution of a program takes more time since they are compiled.	|Execution of a script takes less time as scripts are generally short.
|It is used to create a new program or piece of software from the scratch.|	It is used to enhance an existing program or automate a specific task. A scripting language is used to control the behavior of a program.|
|Most regular programming languages are stronger in data and control abstraction.|	Scripting languages generally emphasize the extensibility and richness of expressions.|
| Runs or executes independently.|Runs inside a parent program.|
|Generally requires many lines of code to accomplish a particular task.|Usually requires fewer lines than a programming language to accomplish a task.
|Have high maintenance costs.|	Have a low maintenance cost.|
|Generate .exe files.|Do not create .exe files.|
|User interface design and graphic design are often partially supported by programming languages. |	User interface design, data types, and graphic design are all greatly aided by scripting languages.|
|Programming languages are designed to make full-fledged software development easier.|	Scripting languages are used to assist programming languages and make coding easier and faster. They are typically used for open projects and web development.|
|Programming language code takes a long time to develop since more code must be written (in most cases).|	Scripting languages take less time to code, as fewer lines (in most cases) of code are to be written.|
|Programming languages are self-executable.|	Scripting languages require a host.|
|All programming languages are not scripting languages.	|All scripting languages are programming languages.|
|Examples include C, C++, Java, Python, etc.|	Examples include Perl, PHP, JavaScript, etc.|
