# PHP Error Types  

Errors in PHP are classified into three main categories:  

### **1. Syntax Errors**  
### **2. Runtime errors**
### **3. Logical errors**

# PHP `echo` vs `print`

| Feature       | `echo`             | `print`          |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| Arguments    | Accepts multiple | Only one      |
| Return Value | No               | Returns `1`   |
| Speed        | Faster           | Slower        |
| Usage        | Outputs multiple strings | Outputs one string |

**Conclusion:**  
Both `echo` and `print` are useful for displaying output. However, `echo` is **faster** and supports multiple arguments.

# PHP and Case Sensitivity: Why Is It Partially Case Sensitive?  

Unlike most programming languages, PHP has **partial case sensitivity**:

## Case Sensitivity in PHP  

### **Case-Sensitive Elements**  
- Variables  
- Constants (both user-defined and PHP-defined)  
- Array keys  
- Class properties  

### **Case-Insensitive Elements**  
- Functions  
- Class constructors and methods  
- Keywords and constructs (`if`, `else`, `foreach`, `null`, `echo`, etc.)  

## Why Is PHP Partially Case-Sensitive?  

PHPâ€™s hybrid approach was designed to:  
- **Ensure backward compatibility** with older scripts and legacy applications.  
- **Improve readability**, allowing function and class names to be flexible with case variations.  
- **Offer flexibility**, giving developers control over case sensitivity where needed.  

This approach balances **legacy support** with **modern development practices**, making PHP more adaptable.
